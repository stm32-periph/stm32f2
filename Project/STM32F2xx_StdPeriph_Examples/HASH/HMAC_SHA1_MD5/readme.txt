@par Example Description 

This example provides a short description of how to use the HASH peripheral to 
hash data using HMAC SHA-1 and HMAC MD5 Algorithms.

For this example, no DMA is used for data transfer.
The key used is long type (2088 bit data).
The HMAC SHA-1 message digest result is a 160 bit data and the HMAC MD5 message 
digest result is a 128 bit data.

The HMAC SHA-1 and HMAC MD5 digests can be displayed on a PC HyperTerminal using 
the USART (CN16).

  - HASH/HMAC_SHA1_MD5/system_stm32f2xx.c   STM32F2xx system clock configuration file
  - HASH/HMAC_SHA1_MD5/stm32f2xx_conf.h     Library Configuration file

@note The "system_stm32f2xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F2xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" 
      provided with the AN3362 package available on <a href="http://www.st.com/internet/mcu/family/141.jsp">  ST Microcontrollers </a>


@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs only on STM32F21x Devices (Cryptographic acceleration not 
    embedded in STM32F20x Devices).
  
  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect a null-modem female/female RS232 cable between the DB9 connector 
      CN16 (USART3) and PC serial port.
      @note Make sure that jumper JP22 is in position 1-2
 
  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - flow control: None 


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
