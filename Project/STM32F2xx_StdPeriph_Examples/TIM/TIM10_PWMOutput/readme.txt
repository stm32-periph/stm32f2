@par Example Description

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral in PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) 
mode.

The TIM10CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock(Hz), to get TIM10 counter
clock at 20 MHz the Prescaler is computed as following:
   - Prescaler = (TIM10CLK / TIM10 counter clock) - 1
   
SystemCoreClock is set to 120 MHz for STM32F2xx Devices RevA, RevZ and RevB.

The TIM10 is running at 30 KHz: TIM10 Frequency = TIM10 counter clock/(ARR + 1)
                                                = 20 MHz / 666 = 30 KHz

The TIM10 CCR1 register value is equal to 500, so the TIM10 Channel 1 generates a 
PWM signal with a frequency equal to 30 KHz and a duty cycle equal to 50%:

TIM10 Channel1 duty cycle = (TIM10_CCR1/ TIM10_ARR + 1)* 100 = 50%

The PWM waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F2xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.
    
  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the following pin to an oscilloscope PF.06: (TIM10_CH1)

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
