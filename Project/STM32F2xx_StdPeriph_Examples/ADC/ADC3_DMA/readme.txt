@par Example Description 

This example describes how to use the ADC3 and DMA to transfer continuously 
converted data from ADC3 to memory.
The ADC3 is configured to convert continuously channel7.
Each time an end of conversion occurs the DMA transfers, in circular mode, the
converted data from ADC3 DR register to the ADC3ConvertedValue variable.

In this example, the system clock is 120MHz, APB2 =60MHz and ADC clock = APB2 /2. 
Since ADC3 clock is 30 MHz and sampling time is set to 3 cycles, the total 
conversion time is 0.5 us (2Msps).

User can vary the ADC3 channel7 voltage using the Eval Board potentiometer
The converted voltage is displayed on the Eval Board LCD (when the define PRINT_ON_LCD
is enabled in main.c)

@note The "system_stm32f2xx.c" is generated by an automatic clock configuration 
      tool and can be easily customized to your own configuration. 
      To select different clock setup, use the "STM32F2xx_Clock_Configuration_V1.0.0.xls" tool. 


@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F2xx Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STM322xG-EVAL RevB and can be easily tailored
    to any other development board.

  - STM322xG-EVAL Set-up
    - Use the Potentiometer (RV1) of the Eval board (connected to PF.09). 


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Copy all source files from this example folder to the template folder under
   Project\STM32F2xx_StdPeriph_Template
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
